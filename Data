Note: The raw data files are too large to upload to GitHub

If you'd like to download them locally:
  1. Go to Google's quickdraw_dataset (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/raw?pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false)
  2. Download the raw circle, diamond, octagon, square, triangle, and zigzag .ndjson files (you can also use the simplified files, but that decreases accuracy significantly)
  3. Store files in this Data folder with the following naming convention: <shape>.ndjson (e.g. circle.ndjson)
